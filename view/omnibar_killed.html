<body>
    <p>The "Panic" button in the "Advertisements" panel on the dashboard was pressed.</p>
    <p>
        This was likely done because the operator needed to open an instance of the omnibar/advertisement
        display,<br/> but could not do so because there was already an instance open somewhere else, and they
        did not know where.
